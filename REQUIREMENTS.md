# PUConnect - Campus Talent Marketplace Requirements

PUConnect is a peer-to-peer marketplace designed for university campus communities to connect students with specialized skills to those in need of assistance.

## 1. Core Purpose
The platform facilitates the exchange of services and talent between students, enabling peer-to-peer freelancing and collaboration.

## 2. Key User Personas
*   **Base / default (Seeker)**: On registration, every user is a **Seeker** first. Seekers browse the marketplace and can post **service requests** and **need-help** ads so that skilled users can discover and respond.
*   **Provider**: A user who has **upgraded** their account by submitting provider-oriented information—skills they can offer and additional **trust and security**-relevant details required to offer services credibly on campus. Providers can publish **service offerings** (not only respond to requests).
*   **Dual-role**: A user may act as **Seeker only**, **Provider only**, or **both**. Seeking is always in scope by default; provider capabilities are **additive** after upgrade.

## 3. Core Functional Pillars

### 3.0. User Roles & Permissions
*   **Seeker by default**: New accounts are Seekers. All signed-in Seekers may create **service requests** (need-help / request listings).
*   **Provider eligibility**: Publishing **service offerings** requires completing the **provider upgrade** (skills offered, plus trust/security fields as defined by the product). Until then, the user cannot post as a provider.
*   **Modes**: The same person may remain seeker-only, become provider-only in practice, or use **both** request and offer listing types according to the rules above.

### 3.1. Unified Discovery Feed
*   **Mixed Feed**: Both "Service Offerings" and "Service Requests" appear in the same primary feed.
*   **Tabbed Filtering**: Users can toggle between "Services" and "Requests" using tabs.
*   **Discovery**: Providers skew toward finding **Requests**; Seekers skew toward finding **Services**—while everyone can use both tabs.

### 3.2. Lifecycle & Trust
*   **Negotiation Bridge**: Interacting with any ad leads to Chat.
*   **Hiring/Completion**: A "Mark as Hired" or "Complete Service" action in the Chat interface officially concludes the negotiation/work.
*   **Review System**: Completion triggers the ability to leave a rating/review, building trust without a payment gateway.

### 3.3. Identity & Privacy
*   **Basic Identity**: Cards and profiles highlight basic info (e.g., Level/Year, Department) to establish campus credibility.
*   **Identity Source**: Information is pulled from account creation to ensure a smooth, non-intrusive experience.
*   **Provider upgrade**: Collects **additional** identity and trust-oriented fields beyond minimal registration (e.g. skills offered, verification or other security signals as the product requires).

### 3.4. Payment & Transactions
*   **No Payment Gateway**: The platform does not handle financial transactions.
*   Payments are negotiated and settled externally between the users.

## 4. UI/UX Principles
*   **Mobile-First & Responsive**: Full support for portrait and landscape orientations across all device sizes.
*   **Premium Aesthetics**: Modern, fluid, and high-fidelity "Liquid Glass" design system.
*   **Interaction-Focused**: Minimizing friction between finding a service and starting a conversation.

- **Entry page:** `Landing` or `Login`
- **Page-to-page flow:**
  1. `Landing` -> `Login`
  2. `Login` -> `Register` (optional path)
  3. `Register` -> `Login`
  4. `Login` -> `Home / Market`
- **What the user does:**
  - Starts from landing, then signs in or creates an account.

## 5. Mobile (Android) — Screen QA Checklist

> **Already addressed (But can be verified and improved):** Layout, Theming, State Management, Navigation.
> The checklist below covers the **remaining audit categories** for every screen.

Legend: `[ ]` = TODO · `[/]` = In Progress · `[x]` = Done



---

---

> [!NOTE]
> **Scope:** Development is currently focused exclusively on the **`mobile/`** directory. All updates must respect and build upon the existing implementation patterns and logical foundations already established in the codebase.
[!NOTE]
>Checklist items might not be up to date with latest screen implementation.

### 5.1 Landing / Splash (`app/index.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [x] Splash logo fades in for ~2.5 s then transitions to the landing content
- [x] Dynamic horizontal carousel with 4 slides (Welcome, Seek, Offer, Start)

- [x] Email format validation (e.g., must be a valid email pattern)
- [x] Rapid multi-tap on "Create Account" guarded

#### Performance
- [x] Many animated inputs on one screen — verify no frame drops during entrance animations
- [x] No memory leak from animations on unmount

#### Input & Keyboard
- [x] `autoCapitalize="words"` on Full Name
- [x] `autoCapitalize="none"` on Email and University ID
- [x] `keyboardType="email-address"` on Email

---

### 5.5 Messages (`app/(tabs)/messages.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Unauthenticated: shows lock icon + "Sign In" button → navigates to `/login`
- [ ] Authenticated + no messages: shows empty state with "Explore Market" → navigates to `/(tabs)/home`
- [ ] Authenticated + messages: shows `FlatList` of conversation previews
- [ ] Each conversation press navigates to `/chat/[id]` with correct sender ID

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] N/A (no text inputs on this screen)

---

### 5.6 Search / Categories (`app/(tabs)/search.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic

- [ ] Listing card press navigates to `/listing/[id]`
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works
- [ ] Empty state shows "No students offering this service yet"

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] N/A (no text inputs on this screen)

---

- [ ] Shows description section
- [ ] Shows expertise/skills tags if listing has `requiredSkills`
- [ ] Shows seller/provider card with "View Profile" button

- [ ] Very long description: scrollable
- [ ] External image fails to load: placeholder or graceful fallback

#### Performance
- [ ] Single `ScrollView` for content — appropriate
- [ ] Bottom bar uses `position: absolute` — doesn't scroll with content
- [ ] Image loaded from remote URL — consider caching

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] N/A (no text inputs on this screen)

---

### 5.10 Chat (`app/chat/[id].tsx`)

#### Performance
- [ ] `ScrollView` for messages — consider `FlatList` if message count grows
- [ ] `KeyboardAvoidingView` in place for input area
- [ ] Multiline input expansion capped at `maxHeight: 100`

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] Text input is `multiline`
- [ ] Keyboard pushing input area up (via `keyboardAvoiding` on `ScreenLayout`)
- [ ] Placeholder text "Type a message..." visible
- [ ] Input retains value while typing (controlled component)

- [ ] Portfolio link items show remove icon; tapping removes them
- [ ] Switch toggles with track color change
- [ ] Camera badge overlay on avatar indicates editability

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Avatar picker has `accessibilityLabel="Change profile picture"`
- [ ] Each text input has a label
- [ ] Skill tags have `accessibilityRole="button"` and state (selected/not)
- [ ] Switch has associated label ("Available for Hire")
- [ ] Remove portfolio link buttons have labels
- [ ] Save button has label

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] No token (user not authenticated): `handleSave` returns early safely
- [ ] Graduating year is non-numeric: `parseInt` returns `NaN` — validate
- [ ] Duplicate portfolio link: prevented by `!portfolioLinks.includes(newLink)`
- [ ] Empty portfolio link: prevented by `newLink &&` check
- [ ] Image picker permission denied: handle gracefully
- [ ] Image upload fails: error caught and alert shown
- [ ] Bio exceeds 300 chars: `maxLength={300}` enforces limit
- [ ] 0 skills selected: should still save without error

#### Performance
- [ ] Full-screen scrollable form — scrolls smoothly with many fields
- [ ] Image picker library loading does not block UI
- [ ] `keyboardAvoiding` prevents content from being hidden

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] Department and Graduation Year inputs have proper keyboard types (`numeric` for year)
- [ ] Bio `TextInput` is multiline with `textAlignVertical="top"`
- [ ] Portfolio link input has `returnKeyType="done"` and `onSubmitEditing` that adds the link
- [ ] Keyboard avoidance works for all fields, especially the portfolio link input near the bottom
- [ ] Keyboard dismiss when scrolling or tapping outside inputs

### 5.14 Explore (Hidden Tab — `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`)

> This screen is a scaffolding/example screen (`href: null` in tabs). Verify it doesn't break anything.

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Shows Expo starter template collapsible sections
- [ ] External links open in browser
- [ ] Does not appear in tab bar (`href: null`)

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Deep-linking to this route directly doesn't crash

---

### 5.15 Modal (`app/modal.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Shows "This is a modal" text
- [ ] "Go to home screen" link dismisses modal and navigates to root
- [ ] Presented as a modal (slide-up presentation)

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Dismissing via system back gesture works on Android

---

### 5.16 Create Listing (`app/listing/create.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Handles both new listings and editing existing listings (`editId` via params)
- [ ] Gated logic: Service offers demand provider eligibility (`canOfferServices`); blocks plain seekers
- [ ] Requires Title, Description, Budget/Price, and a Category
- [ ] On save, sends data to API and navigates to `/profile/my-listings`

#### User Feedback & Interactions
- [ ] Submit button shows loading indicator and is disabled during API submission
- [ ] Pressable chips for listing type / categories show active visual status
- [ ] Immediate alerts/errors for validation failures (e.g., negative price, empty title)

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Input fields and text sections must be labelled for screen readers
- [ ] Back button has an accessible label (`accessibilityLabel="Go back"`)

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Non-authenticated user block / redirect handles safely
- [ ] Attempting to change to `service_offer` without `user.canOfferServices` reverts state safely
- [ ] Editing an invalid `id` catches gracefully and navigates back

#### Performance
- [ ] ScrollView contains all text inputs efficiently without lag

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] `KeyboardAvoidingView` manages the form pushing up above the OS keyboard
- [ ] Description uses multiline text input with `textAlignVertical="top"`
- [ ] Price field restricts input to `decimal-pad` type

---

### 5.17 Public Profile (`app/profile/[id].tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Loads target user by `id` parameter
- [ ] Displays avatar, name, verification badge, department, class year, bio, and skill tags
- [ ] Displays horizontal list of the user's active listings
- [ ] "Message" button navigates to `/chat/[id]` (hidden if viewing own profile)

#### User Feedback & Interactions
- [ ] Full screen `ActivityIndicator` during initial API fetch
- [ ] Horizontal scroll handles active listings fluidly
- [ ] Not-found state dynamically handles missing IDs with a "Go back" option

#### Accessibility
- [ ] User's name is structured as the primary heading
- [ ] Tags and bio are structured for assistive tech reading
- [ ] Avatar image has an explicit descriptive label

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Profile with 0 listings safely renders string fallback ("No active listings yet")
- [ ] Very long bio text formats correctly without breaking layout
- [ ] Profile with missing/empty optional fields (bio, department) resolves without crashing

#### Performance
- [ ] Avatar relies on fallback icons when external URL is empty/failing

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] N/A

---

### 5.18 My Listings (`app/profile/my-listings.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Displays an exclusive list of the authenticated user's active listings
- [ ] Tabbed filters toggle locally between 'All', 'Requests', and 'Offers'
- [ ] Each item offers 'Edit' (navigates to create with `editId`) and 'Remove' (fires delete API)

#### User Feedback & Interactions
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh mechanism active via `RefreshControl`
- [ ] Deletion requires a destructive confirmation dialog (`Alert`)
- [ ] Dynamic empty state matches current tab filter ('No request listings...' vs 'No active listings...')

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Filter chips have tab or button semantics with selected state definitions
- [ ] Empty states announce accurately to screen readers

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Tab initialization from URL params (`?tab=requests`) works accurately on load
- [ ] Deletion of the final listing falls back cleanly to the empty state without crash

#### Performance
- [ ] Utilizes `FlatList` for virtualized rendering of listings

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] N/A

---

### 5.19 Review (`app/review/[id].tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Pulls `listingId` and `targetUserId` from route params
- [ ] Collects a rating selection (1 to 5 stars) and a text area comment
- [ ] Submits review and navigates explicitly back to Home

#### User Feedback & Interactions
- [ ] Visual selection state on star buttons highlights up to the selected value limit
- [ ] "Submit review" button shows disabled opacity during transaction

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Star buttons describe their integer value clearly to screen readers
- [ ] Comment input is securely labelled

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Block system intercepts and prevents submit with whitespace-only/empty string
- [ ] Missing URL parameters halt UI sequence and prompt user to back out

#### Performance
- [ ] Component is minimal; rendering handles fast response times

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] `KeyboardAvoidingView` offsets inputs flawlessly
- [ ] Multiline comment box maintains physical integrity (min height setup)

---

### 5.20 Search Results (`app/search/results.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Consumes global query input (`q`) and optional specific `section` strings
- [ ] Initiates a dedicated search API request dynamically on load and re-submission
- [ ] Display list dynamically reacts to returns

#### User Feedback & Interactions
- [ ] Dynamic spinner triggers over list, not blocking the persistent header / query input
- [ ] Distinct "No listings match your search" empty state with clear iconography

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Search input has explicit label defining its action
- [ ] Standardized list view maps descriptions per item cleanly

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty or whitespace query doesn't overload system constraints
- [ ] Cleanup sequences drop inflight requests if user quickly exits

#### Performance
- [ ] Standardized optimization through standard `FlatList` arrays

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] Device "Search" / "Enter" submits explicitly via `onSubmitEditing`
- [ ] Keyboard dismissal activates upon scroll

---

### 5.21 Settings (`app/settings.tsx`)

#### Purpose & Logic
- [ ] Houses core local preferences (Appearance, Demo notification toggles, Account actions)
- [ ] Dark Mode toggle explicitly executes `setMode` within the `useTheme` context
- [ ] Mocks "Forgot password" interaction via simplistic alert

#### User Feedback & Interactions
- [ ] Switch interactions reliably match the active system status visually
- [ ] Stubs/Alerts react instantly upon press commands

#### Accessibility
- [ ] `Switch` items possess explicit `accessibilityRole="switch"` or correlated text logic
- [ ] Section headers structured with clear reading flow

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Changing theme repeatedly resolves fast with no visible deadlock

#### Performance
- [ ] Re-renders execute effortlessly given small scale of DOM layout

#### Input & Keyboard
- [ ] N/A

---

### 5.22 Cross-Screen Global Checks

#### System UI (Root Layout — `app/_layout.tsx`)
- [ ] Status bar style syncs with theme (light ↔ dark)
- [ ] Android navigation bar button style syncs with theme
- [ ] System root background color syncs with `theme.background` (prevents white flash)
- [ ] `AppState` listener doesn't leak (cleanup on unmount)

#### Tab Bar (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)
- [ ] Tab bar height adjusts in landscape vs portrait
- [ ] Tab bar respects safe area insets (bottom, left, right in landscape)
- [ ] Active tab shows filled icon, inactive shows outline icon
- [ ] Tab labels display correctly
- [ ] Hidden tabs (explore, onboarding) don't appear in tab bar
- [ ] Tab bar background is semi-translucent
- [ ] iOS: BlurView behind tab bar

#### Auth Flow
- [ ] Guest user can browse Home/Market and Categories without signing in
- [ ] Messages tab enforces sign-in (shows lock icon)
- [ ] Profile tab shows guest login form when not authenticated
- [ ] After sign-in, profile and messages populate from user data
- [ ] After sign-out, user returns to landing and auth state is cleared

#### Orientation & Responsiveness
- [ ] All screens render correctly in portrait
- [ ] All screens render correctly in landscape
- [ ] Content does not clip behind system bars (notch, nav bar) in landscape
- [ ] Horizontal scroll sections on Home still work in landscape
